# Social Media Network Analysis (Academic Project)

## Overview
This project applies network analysis techniques to social media interaction data to understand information flow, influence, and engagement patterns. The analysis was conducted as part of an academic analytics project.

## Scope of Analysis
- Construction of interaction networks from social media data
- Centrality measures (e.g. PageRank, Betweenness)
- Identification of influential nodes and structural patterns
- Supporting insights using text-based analysis

## Key Takeaways
- A small subset of users drive a disproportionate share of engagement
- Network position matters as much as content volume
- Structural gaps highlight opportunities for improved information flow

## Deliverables
- Jupyter notebook with network and text analysis
- Visualizations illustrating network structure and influence patterns
- A detailed academic report documenting methodology and findings

## Tools Used
Python, Network Analysis, Graph Theory, Text Analysis
